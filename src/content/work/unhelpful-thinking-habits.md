### Description:
<br />
My counselor at the time noticed that I seemed to default to certain ways of thinking about myself. She gave me a two-sided handout with useful and (most importantly) actionable information. However, the inconvenience of having to carry around a sheet of paper made it less useful or convenient.
<br/><br/>
Since I know I won't be carrying it around with me, I bet others won't either. So I made it into a small PWA (Progressive Web App) using **Polymer**. It will also be *open-source* so that others can see how it's made and learn from it. Feedback is always welcome.
<br/><br/>
I hope this small tool helps someone out there in need of a little self-help. I know I need it from time to time.
