    My counselor at the time noticed that I seemed to default to certain ways of thinking about myself. She gave me a two-sided handout with useful and (most importantly) actionable information. However, the inconvenience of having to carry around a sheet of paper made it less useful or convenient.
    <br />
    Since I know I won't be carrying it around with me, I bet others won't either. So I made it into a small PWA (Progressive Web App) using Polymer. It will also be <a class="interactive link" href="https://github.com/areddicks1014/unhelpful-thinking-habits">open source <Icon name="mdi:external-link" /></a> so that others can see how it's made and learn from it. Feedback is always welcome.
    <br />
    I hope this small tool helps someone out there in need of a little self-help. I know I need it from time to time.
