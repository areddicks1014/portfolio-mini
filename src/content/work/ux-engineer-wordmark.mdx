    I designed the UX Engineer wordmark to convey the combination of the UX and Engineering departments at a previous company. 
    I used the Proxima Nova font for the "UX" portion and Fira Code for the "Engineer" part.
    <br />
    Creating this in Figma was a great learning opportunity since I had not used Figma very much before that. I learned about
    how to use layers, vectors/shapes, fonts, colors, and joining selections. More importantly, I realized that Figma wasn't just 
    for creating UX wireframes, mockups, and layouts, etc., but it could be used to create even more as an illustrator.
