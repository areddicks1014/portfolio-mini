### Description
<br />
Live Updates ("Rich Ongoing Notifications" during beta) for Android could be extremely useful for a variety of apps and contexts. I created some mockups of basic and custom example usages for things like Fitbit exercise activities, an eclipse timer, a presidential election tracker, live football game stats, and more.

<br />

The 'Live Updates' feature went through many iterations behind the scenes over the course of the Android 16 Beta which changed how the chips (and eventual notifications themselves) would work. For the most part, the chips design hasn't changed very much since it's still just an icon, text, and chip background color. Hopefully in the future we can have more control over the notification chips and be able to apply more unique designs and ways of displaying useful contextual information.
