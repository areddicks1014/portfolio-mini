<Panel headerText='Project Goal and Objectives' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
    <Panel headerText='Goal' headerSize='4' inside backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
        To improve Design System Requests (DSR) and their progress through the review process, making it more transparent and efficient for all stakeholders.
    </Panel>

    <Panel headerText='Objectives' headerSize='4' inside backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
        - Identify and document pain points in the existing DSR status tracking process.
        - Understand user needs and expectations regarding status updates, timelines, and communication.
        - Synthesize research data into actionable recommendations for a user-centered status tracking solution.
        - Provide a plan for iterative improvement based on user feedback.

<Panel headerText='My Roles' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **UX Researcher**: Conducted user research to identify areas for improvement.
- **Collaborator**: Work with stakeholders across design, development, and product teams to gather and incorporate insights.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Target Users' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
Designers, developers, managers, and product owners who rely on the design system and need to track the status of Design System Requests.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Research Methodology' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **User Interviews:** Conducted in-depth interviews with designers, developers, and managers 
using open-ended questions and prompts to understand the users' experiences with the existing status tracking process.
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Used scenario-based questions during interviews to understand how users currently manage multiple requests, 
track stalled items, and find details from past reviews. 
- **Thematic Analysis:** Analyzed interview transcripts to identify recurring themes, patterns, and user pain points.
- **Documentation Review:** Examined existing DSR process documentation to identify gaps and areas for clarification.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Themes' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **Process Frustration:** Many users expressed frustration with the current system due to its lack of transparency and efficiency.
- **Information Overload:** Users felt overwhelmed by scattered information and a lack of a single source of truth.
- **Time Sensitivity:** Users emphasized the need for timely updates and status notifications to manage their work effectively.
- **Need for Formalization:** Users wanted a formal and more consistent review and feedback process.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Key Insights' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **Lack of Centralized Tracking:** The most significant finding was the lack of a central system, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
- **Desire for Clear Status Definitions:**  Users needed specific and easily understandable status labels, as well as clear definitions of what the various states mean.
- **Importance of Timelines:** There was a consistent request for a timeline view for each request, showing its progression and estimated completion time.
- **Workflow Issues:** Users reported difficulties understanding the current review process, particularly for mobile vs. web requests.
- **Need for Improved Communication:** Users wanted improved methods of communication, including being notified when the status of items changes and clear communication of the types of assistance offered.
- **Mobile and Web Differentiation:** Participants noted that the mobile process and the web process seemed very different.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Recommendations' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- Establish a centralized DSR status tracking system, preferably in ADO, to increase visibility.
- Define and implement clear status definitions for tracking.
- Integrate a timeline view for each request to show progress.
- Incorporate regular status meetings to address questions and manage expectations.
- Develop a formal review and feedback process.
- Regularly evaluate the process, gathering user feedback for continuous improvement.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Outcomes' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **Improved Transparency:** The new system provides a clear view of each DSR.
- **Increased Efficiency:**  The improved workflow helps reduce confusion and time spent creating and tracking DSRs.
- **Better Collaboration:**  The central platform for the process improved collaboration between the designers and developers.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='Impact' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **Actionable Recommendations:** The research generated clear, actionable recommendations for improving the DSR status tracking system.
- **User-Focused Design:** Emphasis on a user-focused approach guided us towards solutions that meet real needs.
- **Iterative Improvement:** By gathering research during the design process, we will be able to make iterative improvements over time based on continuous user feedback.
</Panel>
<br />

<Panel headerText='What I Learned' headerSize='3' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
- **Importance of User Research:** User interviews and testing are crucial to identifying pain points and designing effective solutions.
- **Value of Centralized Systems:** Having a centralized system greatly improved team collaboration and transparency.
- **Clear Communication:** Clear and concise communication regarding the process is critical to a successful workflow.
