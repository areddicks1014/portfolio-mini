    The current Design System Request (DSR) process lacks transparency and efficiency, causing significant issues for designers, developers, managers, and product owners. Users are frustrated by scattered information across multiple channels, with no single source of truth for the status of their requests. The lack of a formal review process and clear statuses makes it difficult for teams to manage their work effectively. The research was conducted through user interviews, scenario-based questions, and analysis of existing DSR documentation to develop user-centered solutions.

    <Panel headerText="What is a Design System Request?" headerSize='4' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)' class='inside'>
    A **Design System Request** is a formal proposal for a new component, pattern, or update to the existing design system. These requests are submitted by designers, developers, or product owners and undergo a review process to ensure quality, consistency, and usability across all products.
    </Panel>
    <Panel headerText="What is wrong with the process?" headerSize='4' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)' class='inside'>
    Design System Requests were handled by either email, messages, work items (through Azure Dev Ops), or some combination of those. This meant that there could often be duplicate requests, stalled work, missed timelines, or stakeholders left out of the loop. This also means that any context surrounding DSRs were often lost due to broken email chains, messages deleted due to company policies, or work items not being updated. Each person also had their own level of specificity when it came to the progress of each request that was being kept track of, which led to confusion if the designer, management, or stakeholders changed.

    <Panel headerText='Objectives' headerSize='4' class='inside' backgroundColor='var(--gray-999-rgb)'>
        - Identify and document pain points in the existing DSR status tracking process to establish a starting place for finding solutions.
        - Understand user needs and expectations regarding status updates, timelines, and communication to properly set the scope of the problems needing to be solved.
        -  Synthesize research data into actionable recommendations for a user-centered status tracking solution to present to stakeholders.
        - Provide a plan for iterative continuous improvement based on user feedback so that we can prevent this type of situation from occurring in the future.
