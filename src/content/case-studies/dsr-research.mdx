### Background
<br />
The current Design System Request (DSR) process lacks transparency and efficiency, causing significant issues for designers, developers, managers, and product owners. 
Users are frustrated by scattered information across multiple channels, with no single source of truth for request status. 
The lack of a formal review process and clear statuses makes it difficult for teams to manage their work effectively. 
The research was conducted through user interviews, scenario-based questions, and analysis of existing DSR documentation to develop user-centered solutions.

### Project Goal and Objectives
<br />
#### Goal
<br />
To improve the Design System Review (DSR) and their progress through the review process, 
making it more transparent and efficient for all stakeholders.

#### Objectives 
<br />
- Identify and document pain points in the existing DSR status tracking process.
- Understand user needs and expectations regarding status updates, timelines, and communication.
- Synthesize research data into actionable recommendations for a user-centered status tracking solution.
- Provide a plan for iterative improvement based on user feedback.

### Research Methodology 
<br />
- **User Interviews:** Conducted in-depth interviews with designers, developers, and managers 
using open-ended questions and prompts to understand the users' experiences with the existing status tracking process.
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Used scenario-based questions during interviews to understand how users currently manage multiple requests, 
track stalled items, and find details from past reviews. 
- **Thematic Analysis:** Analyzed interview transcripts to identify recurring themes, patterns, and user pain points.
- **Documentation Review:** Examined existing DSR process documentation to identify gaps and areas for clarification.

### Themes 
<br />
- **Process Frustration:** Many users expressed frustration with the current system due to its lack of transparency and efficiency.
- **Information Overload:** Users felt overwhelmed by scattered information and a lack of a single source of truth.
- **Time Sensitivity:** Users emphasized the need for timely updates and status notifications to manage their work effectively.
- **Need for Formalization:** Users wanted a formal and more consistent review and feedback process.

### Key Insights
<br />
- **Lack of Centralized Tracking:** The most significant finding was the lack of a central system, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
- **Desire for Clear Status Definitions:**  Users needed specific and easily understandable status labels, as well as clear definitions of what the various states mean.
- **Importance of Timelines:** There was a consistent request for a timeline view for each request, showing its progression and estimated completion time.
- **Workflow Issues:** Users reported difficulties understanding the current review process, particularly for mobile vs. web requests.
- **Need for Improved Communication:** Users wanted improved methods of communication, including being notified when the status of items changes and clear communication of the types of assistance offered.
- **Mobile and Web Differentiation:** Participants noted that the mobile process and the web process seemed very different.

### Recommendations 
<br />
- Establish a centralized DSR status tracking system, preferably in ADO, to increase visibility.
- Define and implement clear status definitions for tracking.
- Integrate a timeline view for each request to show progress.
- Incorporate regular status meetings to address questions and manage expectations.
- Develop a formal review and feedback process.
- Regularly evaluate the process, gathering user feedback for continuous improvement.

### Outcomes 
<br />
- **Improved Transparency:** The new system provides a clear view of each DSR.
- **Increased Efficiency:**  The improved workflow helps reduce confusion and time spent creating and tracking DSRs.
- **Better Collaboration:**  The central platform for the process improved collaboration between the designers and developers.

### Impact 
<br />
- **Actionable Recommendations:** The research generated clear, actionable recommendations for improving the DSR status tracking system.
- **User-Focused Design:** Emphasis on a user-focused approach guided us towards solutions that meet real needs.
- **Iterative Improvement:** By gathering research during the design process, we will be able to make iterative improvements over time based on continuous user feedback.

### What I Learned 
<br />
- **Importance of User Research:** User interviews and testing are crucial to identifying pain points and designing effective solutions.
- **Value of Centralized Systems:** Having a centralized system greatly improved team collaboration and transparency.
- **Clear Communication:** Clear and concise communication regarding the process is critical to a successful workflow.
